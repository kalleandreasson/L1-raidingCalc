### Comment

Everything went as planned. Next test iteration will be more focused on the commands and not the discord server/guild

The system felt good. One thing that could be improved is the message you receive once auth was successful. Could be better than just a plain text saying 'auth success'. Other than that the system is smooth and easy to use.
